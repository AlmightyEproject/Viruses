    <h2>Virus Duvenhage</h2>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Beginning in 1970, there have to date been only five reports of the isolation of Duvenhage virus (DUVV) (Paweska et al., 2006; Van Eeden, Markotter & Nel, 2011; van Thiel et al., 2009; Weyer et al., 2011). The first isolate was in a human from South Africa, the second from an insectivorous bat in South Africa, initially identified as</p>

        Miniopterus schreibersii, but now designated as Miniopterus natalensis, the third from another species of insectivorous bat, Nycteris thebaica, captured in Zimbabwe and the fourth was again from a human in South Africa (Paweska et al., 2006). The last report was of a human case diagnosed in The Netherlands after exposure of the patient to a bat in Kenya

        Thogotovirus is a genus of enveloped RNA viruses, one of seven genera in the virus family Orthomyxoviridae. Their single- stranded, negative-sense RNA genome has six or seven segments. Thogotoviruses are distinguished from most other orthomyxoviruses by being

        Although a review of all DUVV sequence data might suggest a larger number of isolations, the assignment of individual isolates with different designations by different groups has confused the issue significantly. The four DUVV viruses recovered from southern Africa are highly homogeneous, possibly reflecting the limited geographical range over which they were retrieved (Amengual, Whitby, King, Serra-Cobo & Bourhy, 1997; Badrane, Bahloul, Perrin & Tordo, 2001; Delmas et al., 2008; Johnson, McElhinney, Smith, Lowings & Fooks, 2002; Nadin-Davis et al., 2002; Paweska et al., 2006).

        The isolate from Kenya, which is not represented in Figure 4.2 because only partial N gene sequence is currently available, is genetically the most diverse (van Thiel et al., 2009) and may represent a second lineage of this species
