        <h3>2. Life characteristics</h3>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            There are differing opinions as to whether viruses are a form of life, or just organic structures that interact with living things. They have been described as "organisms at the edge of life",[10] because they resemble living organisms in that they carry genes and evolve through the process of living.  natural selection,[60] and can reproduce by making numerous copies of themselves by self-assembly. However, they do not have the cellular structure, which is often considered the basic unit of life. Viruses also do not have a metabolic system of their own, and require a host cell to produce new individuals. They are therefore unable to reproduce spontaneously outside of host cells[61] â€“ although certain species of bacteria such as Rickettsia and Chlamydia are recognized as living organisms. [62][63]Accepted life forms typically use cell division to reproduce, while viruses self-assemble inside cells. They also differ from the autogenous growth of crystals, since they inherit genetic mutations and are subject to natural selection. Viral self-assembly in host cells has important implications for the study of the origin of life, and supports the hypothesis that life may have started from self-assembled organic molecules.  .

        <h3>3. Structure</h3>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            Viruses vary in size and shape, collectively known as virus morphologies. In general, viruses are smaller in size than bacteria. Most of the viruses studied were between 20 and 300 nanometers in diameter. Some filoviruses are up to 1400 nm in total length;although their diameter is only about 80 nm. [64]Most viruses cannot be seen with an optical microscope, so scanning and transmission electron microscopes are used to visualize the virions. [65]To increase the contrast between the virus and its surroundings, one must use "stains" with dense electron density. Salt solutions of heavy metals, such as tungsten, can scatter electrons from areas covered by stains. If the virion is covered with stains (staining positive),Fine details will be obscured. The negative staining method therefore helps to overcome this problem when only the background medium is stained. [66]

        </figure>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            A complete viral particle (particle) - called a virion - consists of nucleic acid surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid. This shell is made up of identical protein subunits called capsomeres. [67]Alternatively, the virus may have a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane. The capsid is made from proteins translated by the viral genome, and their shape is the basis for morphological differentiation. [68][69]The protein subunits encoded by the virus will self-assemble to form the capsid, which will generally require the presence of the viral genome. Complex viruses also encode proteins that help in the construction of their capsid. Proteins that bind to nucleic acids are known as nucleoproteins. and the combination of capsid proteins with viral nucleic acids is called a nucleocapsid. The capsid and the entire viral structure can be probed physically (mechanically) through atomic force microscopy. [70][71]In general, there are four main viral morphologies:

                <h4>Spiral</h4>
                <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                    These viruses are made up of a single capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity or a hollow tube. This arrangement leads to the creation of rods or filaments, which can be short and very stiff, or long and very flexible. The genetic material is generally single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), but sometimes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and is fastened to the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and the positively charged fraction on it.  the protein. In general, the length of the helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acids within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of the capsomers. Tobacco mosaic virus - which has been well studied - is an example of a spiral virus. [72]

                <h4>Regular twenty-sided block</h4>
                <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                    Most animal viruses are cuboidal or quasi-spherical, with all twenty faces symmetrical. A regular regular icosahedron is the optimal way to construct a closed shell from identical subunits. The minimum number of capsomeres needed is 12, where each capsomer is made up of five identical subunits. Many viruses, for example rotavirus, have more than 12 capsomeres and appear as spheres but retain symmetry. The capsomer at each vertex is surrounded by five other capsomeres called pentons. Capsomers on triangular faces are surrounded by 6 and are called hexons. [73]The hexon is usually flat in nature and the penton, the structure that makes up 12 vertices, is often curved. The same protein can be subunits of both pentons and hexons, or they can be composed of different proteins.

                <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                    These viruses have a capsid that is not completely twisted or completely hexagonal, and may carry additional structures such as a protein tail or a complex outer septum. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of a regular cuboidal head with a spiral tail;This tail may have a regular hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tails. This tail structure acts as a molecular syringe, which attaches to the host bacterium and then injects the viral genome into the cell. [75]

                <h4>Virus envelope</h4>
                <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                    Some viruses cover themselves with an envelope, which is an modified form of one of the cell membranes: either the outer membrane surrounding the infected host cell, or the inner membrane such as the nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, creating an outer lipid bilayer known as the viral envelope. The membrane is attached to proteins encoded by the viral genome and the host genome;In addition, all lipid membranes and any carbohydrates are of host origin. Influenza viruses and HIV are examples of these types of tactical uses. Most membrane-bound viruses depend on their envelope to infect the host. [76]

                <h4>Big virus</h4>
                <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                    poxviruses are large, complex viruses with unusual morphology. Their genome is attached to a protein inside a central disc structure called a nucleoid. Nucleoid surrounded by a membrane and two organs on either side of unknown function. Viruses have an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein attached to the surface of the envelope. Overall, poxvirus virions are polymorphic, as can be ovate or brick-shaped. [77]Mimivirus is the largest known virus, with a capsid diameter of 400 nm. Protein filaments can protrude from the surface up to 100 nm in length. The capsid has a regular polygonal appearance under the electron microscope, so it is possible that this is a regular cuboid virus. [78]In 2011, researchers discovered a larger virus on the ocean floor near the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. It is tentatively named Megavirus chilensis, and is visible under a basic optical microscope. [79]

                <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                    Some viruses that infect archaea have complex structures that are unrelated to any other virus, with irregular shapes ranging from spindle-shaped to rod-shaped structures.  hook, teardrop shape, or even bottle shape. Other archaea viruses are similar to tailed bacteriophages, and can have a variety of tail structures. [80]

        <h3>4.  Genome</h3>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            There are many genomic structures that can be seen in viruses;they are the group with more structural diversity of genomes than plants, animals, bacteria or archaea. There are millions of different viruses,[6] though only about 5,000 of them have been described in detail. [5]A virus with DNA or RNA genes is called a DNA virus or RNA virus, respectively. Most viruses have an RNA genome. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes, and bacteriophages often have double-stranded DNA genomes. [81]
        </p>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            Viral genomes are circular, as in polyomaviruses, or linear, as in adenoviruses. The type of nucleic acid has nothing to do with the shape of the genome. In RNA viruses or some DNA viruses, the genome is often divided into separate parts, called segments. With RNA viruses, each segment usually codes for only one protein, and they are usually found together in a capsid. However, all segments do not have to be in the same viral virion in order to infect, as demonstrated by the bromine mosaic virus and some other plant viruses. [64]
        </p>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            Viral genomes, regardless of the type of nucleic acid, are nearly always single- or double-stranded. The single-stranded genome contains an unpaired nucleic acid, like half of a ladder cut in half in the middle. The double-stranded genome contains two complementary paired nucleic acids, like an entire ladder. Elements of some virus families, such as those in the family Hepadnaviridae, have a genome that is partly single-stranded and partly double-stranded. [81]
        </p>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            With most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be positive (+) or negative (-), depending on whether they complement the messenger RNA.  (mRNA) of the virus or not. Positive RNA means that it has the same properties as mRNA and therefore has at least part of it that can be translated directly by the host cell. Negative RNA is complementary to mRNA and must therefore be converted to positive RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme before translation. The DNA nomenclature for single-stranded ssDNA genomic viruses is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the coding strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (-) and the noncoding strand is a copy of it (+).  [81]However, some ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have hermaphroditic genomes in which transcription and translation can occur in both strands in a double-stranded replication intermediate.

        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            Genome size varies greatly between species. The smallest viral genome â€“ circovirus ssDNA, of the family Circoviridae â€“ encodes for only two proteins and has a genome size of about 2,000 base pairs;The largest genome â€“ that of the mimivirus â€“ has a genome size of more than 1. 2 million base pairs and encodes for more than 1000 proteins. [83]In general, RNA viruses have smaller genomes than DNA viruses due to higher error rates when replicating, and have an upper limit of maximum size. [37]When this limit is exceeded, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or non-competitive. To overcome this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes â€“ dividing the genome into smaller molecules â€“ to reduce the probability that an error in a single genome will incapacitate the entire genome. On the contrary,DNA viruses generally have larger genomes due to the high precision of their replicating enzymes. [84]However, single-stranded DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, because mutation rates in these genomes can reach as extreme as in single-stranded RNA viruses. [85]
        </p>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            Viruses also undergo genetic variation by several mechanisms. These include a process called genetic drift (or genetic drift) when single bases in RNA or DNA mutate into other bases. Most of these point mutations are "silent" â€“ not changing the protein the gene encodes for â€“ but others may confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to antiviral drugs. [86]Antigenic drift occurs when there is a major change in the viral genome, possibly as a result of recombination or rearrangement of genetic material. When this happens with influenza viruses, pandemics are possible. [87]RNA viruses often exist as pseudo-species (or "variants", quasispecies) or clusters of viruses of the same species but with slightly different genomic nucleoside sequences. 
        </p>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            Segmented genomes also offer evolutionary advantages;Different strains of the same virus with segmented genomes can randomly shuffle and combine genes to produce progeny viruses (children) with unique properties. This is called rearrangement or "viral sex". [89]
        </p>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            Genetic recombination is the process by which one strand of DNA is broken and then inserted into the end of another DNA molecule. This may occur concurrently when viruses infect cells, and studies of virus evolution have shown that recombination is widespread in the species studied. [90]It is common in both RNA viruses and DNA viruses. [91][92]
