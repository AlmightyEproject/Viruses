        Viruses are found anywhere there is life and may have existed since the first living cells evolved.   The origin of viruses is unclear because they do not create fossils, so molecular techniques have been used to compare viral RNA or DNA and are an effective tool for studying how they arise.   In general, there are three main theories to explain the origin of the virus:

        <h3>1.  Degeneration hypothesis</h3>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            This hypothesis suggests that viruses may have once been small cells that parasitized within larger cells.   Over time, genes that are not needed for this parasite are lost.   Bacteria such as Rickettsia and Chlamydia also live inside cells and, like viruses, can only reproduce inside host cells.   These bacteria support the regression hypothesis, since their parasitic dependence may have lost genes that allow them to survive outside the cell.   This hypothesis is also known as the "degeneration hypothesis", or the "reduction hypothesis".

        <h3>2.  Theory of cell origin</h3>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            According to this hypothesis, some viruses may have evolved from fragments of DNA or RNA that "escape" from the genomes of larger organisms.   Escaped DNA can be from plasmids (naked segments of DNA that can move between cells) or from transposons (DNA molecules that multiply and move around to different locations within the genome of the individual).   cells).  [43] Once called "jumping genes", transposons are examples of portable genetic elements and may be the source of some viruses.   They were discovered in maize by Barbara McClintock in 1950.  [44] This hypothesis is sometimes called the "vagrancy hypothesis",[40][45] or the "escape hypothesis".  [42]

        <h3>3.  Co-evolution hypothesis</h3>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            This hypothesis is also known as the "virus-first hypothesis",[42] which proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex protein and nucleic acid molecules at the same time as cells.   Cells first appeared on Earth, and have not been dependent on cells for billions of years.   Viroids are RNA molecules that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat.   However, they share properties similar to some viruses and are often referred to as "subviral agents".  [46] Viroids are important plant pathogens.  [47] They do not encode proteins but do interact with the host cell and use the host cell machinery for their replication.   [48] ​​The human hepatitis D virus has an RNA genome similar to that of viroids but has a protein coat derived from the hepatitis B virus and is incapable of creating an envelope of its own.   Therefore, they are a defective virus and cannot replicate on their own without the help of the hepatitis B virus.  [49] Similarly, sputnik virophage is also dependent on mimivirus, which infects Acanthamoeba castellanii.  [50] Viruses that depend on the presence of other viruses in the host cell are called satellites and may represent an intermediate step in the evolution between viroids and viruses.  [51][52] ] sputnik virophage is also dependent on mimivirus, which infects Acanthamoeba castellanii.  [50] Viruses that depend on the presence of other viruses in the host cell are called satellites and may represent an intermediate step in the evolution between viroids and viruses.  [51][52] ] sputnik virophage is also dependent on mimivirus, which infects Acanthamoeba castellanii.  [50] Viruses that depend on the presence of other viruses in the host cell are called satellites and may represent an intermediate step in the evolution between viroids and viruses.  [51][52] ]

        <h3>4.  Controversy between theories about the origin of the virus</h3>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            In the past, all of these theories have run into problems: the regressive hypothesis does not explain why even the smallest intracellular parasites are in any way similar to viruses.   The escape hypothesis does not account for the complex capsid and other structures of the viral particle.   The virus-first hypothesis, contrary to the definition of viruses, is that they require host cells.  [42] Until now, viruses are recognized to be very ancient and have an origin that predates the fork of life into the three realms.  [53] This finding has prompted modern virologists to reconsider and reevaluate all three of these classical hypotheses.  [53]

            Prions are infectious protein molecules that are not DNA or RNA.  [56] They can cause diseases such as mad cow disease (scrapie), sponge encephalitis in cows (mad cow disease) and chronic wasting disease in deer; In humans, diseases caused by prions include Kuru disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome.  [57] Prions are capable of multiplying because some proteins can exist in two different conformations, and prions change the normal conformation of the host protein to a prion form.   This triggers a chain reaction as each prion protein converts more host proteins into more prions, and these new prions in turn convert more and more proteins into prions; and all known prion-related diseases lead to death.
