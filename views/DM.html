            The body's first line of defense against viruses is the innate immune system. This includes cells and other mechanisms that protect the host from infection in a non-specific way. This means that the cells of the innate system recognize and respond to pathogens in a general way, but unlike the adaptive immune system, it does not confer protective or long-lasting immunity. for the host.

            <h3>1.Measures</h3>
            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                RNA interference is an important innate defense against viruses. [204] Many viruses have replication strategies involving double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases an RNA molecule or its molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. One biochemical pathway - the RISC complex - is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading viral mRNA.

            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defense mechanism by not opening up completely inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through holes in the inner capsid of the seed. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside the virion's core.

            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                When the vertebrate adaptive immune system encounters a virus, it produces specific antibodies to bind to the virus and normally render it unable to infect. This is called humoral immunity. Two types of antibodies are important.

            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralizing the virus but is only produced by cells of the immune system for a few weeks. The latter, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the host's blood is used to check for acute infection, while IgG indicates past infection. [207] IgG antibodies are measured when conducting immunoassays.

            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                Antibodies can continue to be an effective defense mechanism even after the virus has entered the host cell. A protein present in the cell, called TRIM21, can bind to antibodies on the surface of the virus particle. This is indicative of subsequent destruction of the virus by enzymes of the cell's proteosome system.

            <h3>2.Protection Mechanism</h3>
            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                The second vertebrate defense mechanism against viruses is called cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells are constantly evolving. display short fragments of their protein on the cell surface, and if the T cell recognizes a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is killed by 'killer T' cells and Virus-specific T will proliferate. Cells such as macrophages are experts in this antigen presentation process.
            </p>
            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                The production of interferon is an important host defense mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when a virus is present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the virus from multiplying by killing the infected cell and its neighbors.
