    <h2>Virus classification</h2>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Virus taxonomy seeks to describe the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them on the basis of similarities.In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a method of classifying viruses, based on Linnaeus' hierarchy.[119]This system forms the basis for classification by phylum, class, order, family, genus and species.Viruses are grouped according to their common (non-host) properties and the type of nucleic acid that makes up their genome.[120]Later, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was established.However, viruses are not classified by phylum or class, because their small genome size and high mutation rate make it difficult to identify ancestors above the order level.Therefore, the Baltimore classification system was used as an alternative to these traditional ranks.</p>

        <h3>1.Baltimore Classification System</h3>

        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            Nobel Prize-winning biologist David Baltimore invented the Baltimore classification system.[34][125]It is used in conjunction with the ICTV taxonomy in modern virus taxonomy.[126][127][128]

        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            The general structure of the classification system is as follows:

                <dl><dd><a href="" title="Surname (biology)">Family</a> (-viridae)

                According to the 2013 ICTV classification, six orders have been established, including Caudovirales, Herpesvirales, Mononegavirales, Nidovirales, Picornavirales and Tymovirales.A seventh set of Ligamenvirales has also been proposed.The committee informally distinguishes between subspecies, strains and isolates.In total, there are currently 7 orders, 87 families, 19 subfamilies, 349 genera and about 2,827 species.

        <h3>2. ICTV . classification system</h3>

        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) developed the current classification system and wrote guidelines that give greater emphasis to certain properties of viruses in order to maintain their consistency within a family.A unified classification system has been established.The ICTV 7th Report formalized for the first time the concept of virus species as the lowest taxon (group) in the branching hierarchy of viral groups.[121]However, currently only a small fraction of the viral diversity is studied: analysis of samples taken from humans shows that about 20% of the recovered viral sequences are never seen before, analysis of samples from the environment, such as seawater and ocean sediments, helps uncover a large number of sequences that are completely new to humans.[122]

            Baltimore classifies viruses based on the mechanism by which messenger RNA (mRNA) is produced.Viruses must produce mRNA from their genome to produce proteins and copy themselves, but different mechanisms have been used to achieve this within each family of viruses.Viral genomes can be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds), RNA or DNA, and may or may not use reverse transcriptase (RT).In addition, ssRNA viruses can be either positive (+) or negative (−).This classification system sorts viruses into seven groups:
