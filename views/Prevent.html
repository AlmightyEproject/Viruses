            Because viruses use important metabolic pathways in host cells to replicate, they are difficult to eliminate without the use of drugs that are toxic to the host cell in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccination to provide immunity to the infection and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with replication. of the virus.

            <h3>1.Vaccines</h3>
            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                Vaccination is a cheap and effective way to prevent viral infections. Vaccines have been used to prevent viral infections long before the actual virus was discovered. Their use has significantly reduced the morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, mumps, and rubella. [214] Smallpox infections were ruled out. [

            <h3>2.Life characteristics</h3>
            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                There are differing opinions as to whether viruses are a form of life, or just organic structures that interact with living things. They have been described as "organisms at the edge of life", because they resemble living organisms in that they carry genes and evolve through natural selection. however,[60] and can reproduce by making numerous copies of themselves by self-assembling. However, they do not have the cellular structure, which is often considered the basic unit of life. Viruses also do not have a metabolic system of their own, and require a host cell to produce new individuals. They are therefore unable to reproduce spontaneously outside of host cells[61] â€“ although certain species of bacteria such as Rickettsia and Chlamydia are recognized as living organisms.[62][63] Accepted life forms typically use cell division to reproduce, while viruses self-assemble inside cells. They also differ from the autogenous growth of crystals, since they inherit genetic mutations and are subject to natural selection. Viral self-assembly in host cells has important implications for the study of the origin of life, and supports the hypothesis that life may have started from self-assembled organic molecules. .[3] They also differ from the autogenous growth of crystals, since they inherit genetic mutations and are subject to natural selection.

                Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with weakened immunity (described as immunocompromised), because in these people the weakened virus can cause the initial illness. Biotechnology and genetic engineering are used to produce subunit vaccines. These vaccines use only the viral capsid proteins. The hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine.

            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause disease. [222] The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live attenuated strain known as 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever created.

            <h3>3.cAntiviral drugs</h3>
            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues (pseudo-DNA building blocks), which viruses mistakenly incorporate into their genomes during replication. [224] The life cycle of the virus is then stopped because the newly synthesized DNA is inactive. This is because these analogs lack hydroxyl groups, which, along with phosphorus atoms, bind together to form the strong "backbone" of the DNA molecule.
            </p>
            <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                This is called DNA strand termination. [225] Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for Herpes simplex virus infection and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infection. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and commonly prescribed antiretroviral drugs. most frequent.
