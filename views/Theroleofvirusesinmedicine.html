    <h3>1.Introduce</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">A virus is an extremely small infectious agent that is able to reproduce inside living host cells. When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of copies of the original virus structure. Unlike most living organisms, viruses are not cells, so cannot divide on their own and must depend on infected host cells.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Of the millions of viruses that exist in our surroundings, more than 4,800 have been described in detail. The origin of viruses is not really clear: some viruses may have evolved from plasmids (pieces of DNA capable of moving and penetrating between cells), while others may have evolved from bacteria.</p>
    <h3>2.The role of viruses in the ecosystem</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in aquatic environments; Only 1 ml of seawater contains about one million virus particles, and they are essential for the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy bacteria in the aquatic microbiome, and this is the most important carbon recycling mechanism in the marine environment. Organic molecules released from bacterial cells stimulate the growth of new algae and bacteria.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Microorganisms account for more than 90% of marine biomass. It is estimated that viruses kill about 20% of biomass every day, and in the oceans, there are 15 times more viruses than bacteria and archaea. Viruses are primarily responsible for preventing water blooms, a phenomenon that often causes serious harm to other marine life. The number of viruses in the oceans decreases as they go offshore and with the depths of the water, where there are fewer hosts.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">The impact of the virus is enormous. By increasing ocean respiration, the virus is indirectly responsible for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 3 billion tons of carbon each year.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Động vật có vú dưới biển cũng dễ bị nhiễm virus. Vào năm 1988 và 2002, hàng ngàn con hải cẩu bị tử vong ở châu Âu do Phocine morbillivirus. Nhiều loại virus khác như calicillin, herpesvirus, adenovirus và parvovirus tồn tại trong quần thể động vật có vú ở biển.</p>
