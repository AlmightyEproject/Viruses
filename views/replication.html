                <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                    Adsorption is the specific binding of viral capsid proteins to specific receptors on the host cell surface. This specificity helps determine the viral host amplitude. Take HIV, for example, which infects a limited range of human white blood cells. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the molecule CD4 – a chemokine receptor most commonly found on the surface of CD4+ T cells. This mechanism has evolved so that these viruses can infect only the cells in which they are capable of replicating. Adsorption (attachment) to the receptor can induce changes to the proteins of the viral envelope, leading to fusion of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and the viral membrane.

                <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                    Entry after adsorption: Virions enter host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis or membrane fusion. Virus infection of plant and fungal cells is distinct from infection of animal cells. Plants have a strong cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi also have cell walls from chitin, so most viruses can only enter these cells after some damage to the cell wall. .[ninety four] However, nearly all viruses (such as the tobacco virus) can move directly from cell to cell, as single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes through holes called plasmodesma. ).[95] Bacteria, like plants, also have a very strong cell wall that viruses must pierce to infect the cell. Even so,

                    Shedding is the process by which the viral capsid is removed: it can be disintegrated by viral or host cell enzymes or by simple cleavage; and the end result is the release of viral genome nucleic acids.

                <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
                    Viral replication mainly involves the replication of the viral genome. The process of replication includes synthesis of viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from "early" genes (with the exception of positive RNA viruses), protein synthesis, assembly of possible proteins, and finally viral genome replication is regulated by expression of "early" or regulatory proteins. This may involve one or more cycles of mRNA synthesis that - for complex viruses with large genomes - induce "late" gene expression of virion or structural proteins.

                    After structurally regulated self-assembly to form viral particles, some changes in the proteins usually occur. In viruses such as HIV, this change (sometimes called 'maturation') takes place after the virus has been released from the host cell.[97]

                    Viruses can be released from host cells by cytolysis (or cytolysis), a process that kills cells by disrupting the host cell membrane (and cell wall, if present). This is a property of many animal viruses and bacteria. Some viruses undergo dormancy, where the viral genome is incorporated by genetic recombination into a specific location on the host chromosome. The viral genome is now called a "provirus", or in the case of bacteriophages a "prophage".[98] Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is replicated with it. This genome will most of the time be inactive inside the host, however, at some point, the provirus or the prophage can activate the virus, which may in turn destroy the host cell. [99] Enveloped viruses (eg, HIV) are characterized by "budding" from the host cell. During this process, viruses acquire their envelope, which is a fraction of the altered plasma membrane or other endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell.[100]

        <h3>2. Virus DNA</h3>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            The genome replication in most DNA viruses takes place in the nucleus of the cell. If the cell has a suitable receptor on its surface, these viruses will sometimes enter the cell by immediate fusion with the cell membrane (eg, herpes virus) or – or more commonly, by entering the cell. receptor-mediated. Most DNA viruses are completely dependent on the DNA and RNA biosynthetic machinery, and the host cell's RNA processing machinery; however, viruses with larger genomes can encode much of this apparatus on their own. In eukaryotes, viral genomes must penetrate the nuclear membrane to access the apparatus, while in bacteria, they only need to go inside the cell to gain access.[101]

        <h3>3. RNA virus</h3>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            Replication frequently takes place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be divided into one of four different groups depending on their mode of replication. The polarity (i.e. whether it can be used directly by the ribosome to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses is an important criterion determining the mechanism of replication; while the other criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own RNA replication enzymes to make copies of their genomes.[102]

        <h3>4. Reverse transcription virus</h3>
        <p class="p-content p-content-sm">
            These viruses can be single-stranded RNA viruses, ssRNA, (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or double-stranded DNA, dsDNA, (Caulimoviridae and Hepadnaviridae). Viruses that are reverse transcribed with an RNA genome (retrovirus), use a DNA intermediate for replication, while those with a DNA genome (pararetrovirus) use an RNA mediator. Both types have reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, to perform the nucleic acid conversion. The retrovirus will integrate the DNA generated from reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus (latent virus) as a step in the replication cycle; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of some particular pararetroviruses have also been found. [103] In general, retroviruses and pararetroviruses are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit reverse transcriptase, such as zidovudine or lamivudine. An example of a retrovirus is HIV, and an example of a pararetrovirus is the family Hepadnaviridae, which includes the hepatitis B virus.[104]
