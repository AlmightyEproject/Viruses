                    <h2>01.COVID-19 carries long term side-effects, warn experts</h2>
                    <p >
                        As infection cases continue to soar worldwide, the evidence is becoming clear that COVID is simply not just a cold or flu-like infection. It poses risk for people across all age groups, in different degrees and affects some more
                        gravely than the others.
                    </p>
                    <p >
                        On its impact on one's quality of life, we do know that the deadly respiratory virus can have longer-lasting side-effects. For many, viral load may have depleted but some typical symptoms, such as cough, itching throat and
                        fatigue may continue to persist for weeks after combatting the illness. Recovered patients are returning to hospitals, complaining of heart issues, mental distress and much more. Hence, it is even more crucial that we do not
                        simply wait for a vaccine to get over the COVID tide but take stringent measures to keep ourselves away from danger.
                    </p>
                    <h2>02.The study</h2>
                    <p >
                        A new study done in the UK has found more evidence pertaining to the same. 1 in 10 people may be bound to suffer from symptoms of the viral infection or damage, even after successfully recovering from it. Termed 'long COVID', a
                        study conducted by the University of Leeds and Leeds Teaching Hospitals, NHS Trust examined the lives of some recovered COVID patients to identify a pattern of long-lasting symptoms and consequences of the disease, which are
                        more likely to be experienced by people hospitalized due to the infection.
                    </p>
                    <h2>03.What are the symptoms of 'Long COVID'?</h2>
                    <p >
                        The study involved a total of 100 patients, who were split into two focus groups- 32 people who were termed to be critically ill and were hospitalized in intensive care units, while 68 were categorized as suffering from mild or
                        moderate forms of infection, who did not need intensive ICU care. The findings of the study have been published in the Journal of Medical Virology.
                    </p>
                    <p >
                        Upon analysis, it was reported that most patients admitted to suffering from one side-effect or persisting symptom ever after getting okay. There were an array of symptoms recorded, ranging from moderate to severe. It could be
                        classified as follows
                    </p>
                    <h2>04.Fatigue</h2>
                    <p >
                        It can be tough to get back on your feet post-recovery. With COVID, long-lasting fatigue, weakness (which could persist for weeks and months) has been a much-feared consequence. Not only has COVID-fatigue been much widely
                        discussed by experts, but nearly 60% of the patients involved in the study also admitted to suffering from fatigue, lethargy, tiredness in the weeks following recovery. Of these, 1/3rd, who suffered from a critical form of COVID
                        termed their fatigue to be moderate or severe.
                    </p>
                    <p >Apart from this, unbalanced energy levels could also expose patients to experience related symptoms like muscle aches, pins and needles pain, palpitations</p>
                    <p >
                        Improper immune response and inflammatory attack (dubbed the infamous cytokine storm in COVID terminology) has been considered to be one of the causes of energy loss and imbalance. Post-recovery fatigue has also been recorded in
                        the past outbreaks of infections like the SARS and Epstein-Barr virus.
                    </p>
                    <h2>05.Breathlessness</h2>
                    <p ></p>
                    <p ></p>
                    <p >
                        Breathlessness and tugging chest pain could be some of the primary symptoms which could pinpoint how bad your COVID infection is. However, for some patients who have made a recovery from the infection, breathlessness might
                        persist for longer and throw them out of spin. Feeling out of breath, suffering from palpitations were termed to be the second most common after-effects of COVID, with patients admitting to have never suffered from the symptom
                        before the illness. Again, this was found to be much more commonly occurring in those who required intensive care at the hospital.
                    </p>
                    <p >Breathlessness could also be an unpleasant symptom of heart damage or complication, which again, has been a much-feared about a long-term complication with the disease.</p>
                    <h2>06.Memory and cognitive decline</h2>
                    <p >
                        As per the study's findings, one-quarter of the patients who had either moderate or severe form of COVID admitted to suffering from neuropsychological deficits and related symptoms. Symptoms likened to PTSD post-treatment were
                        also observed. Mental distress, problems in memory comprehension or behavior could be triggered due to a variety of factors occurring both inside and outside the recovery center. From the fear of dying, pain, sleep deprivation,
                        lack of mobility or proper communication, social isolation or delirium, all of these factors could make a person's fight with COVID much harder than we could possibly think.
                    </p>
                    <h2>07.Stress and anxiety</h2>
                    <p >
                        The lockdown has brought upon unprecedented stress to our lives but for those battling the disease, or who have made a recovery, stress and anxiety could be much harder to combat, making them more likely to suffer from
                        psychological ailments in the long run. A separate study was done in Italy's hospitals also said that a combination of factors during treatment and post-recovery could increase the likelihood of a patient's mental well-being
                        suffering. Insomnia, depression, anxiety and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) were commonly seen. It was also observed that women were more prone to experiencing psychological distress than men.
                    </p>
                    <h2>08.Degrading quality of life</h2>
                    <p >
                        Nearly 69% of the patients put under intensive care and 49% of those with mild to moderate infections admitted to suffering from problems in rehabilitating back to their lives. There have been links to the multitude of ways the
                        virus could impact one's lung, heart, nervous system and leave deficits in other vital functioning. A sharp decline and degradation in the quality of life were one of the most commonly observed symptoms in a patient's
                        post-treatment. Considering the host of symptoms detailed above and overall changes in their lifestyle, experts say that post-op rehabilitation is something that needs to be direly discussed with COVID treatment and recovery.
